Question: What would be the prompt you would write to display the above table in React as a mindmap?

Answer: While React doesnâ€™t natively support mindmap visualizations, we could conceptualize the table data as nodes in a mindmap, where each data entry (like ID, Title, and Body) would be represented as a child node of a parent node (such as Post). Here's a conceptual prompt for a mindmap-like structure:

Root Node: "Post"
Child Node 1: "ID" (e.g., 1, 2, 3)
Child Node 2: "Title" (e.g., "Post title here")
Child Node 3: "Body" (e.g., "Post body content")
In React, we could represent the data structure like this:

javascript
Copy
Edit
const data = [
  {
    id: 1,
    title: "Post title",
    body: "Post body content"
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    title: "Another title",
    body: "Another post body content"
  }
  // More posts
];
To visualize this as a mindmap, you could use a library like react-mindmap to display nodes and connections dynamically. Alternatively, you can simply display the data in a structured, tree-like format.
